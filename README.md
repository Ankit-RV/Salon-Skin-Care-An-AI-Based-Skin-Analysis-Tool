# Salon-Skin-Care-An-AI-Based-Skin-Analysis-Tool
This is an AI-based skin analysis tool developed for a salon. It can detect three different skin conditions: acne, oiliness, and the need for UV protection. This model is built using machine learning techniques and trained on a dataset of skin images.


### Usage
#### Requirements
Before running the code, you need to install the following packages:

* Tensorflow
* Keras
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* OpenCV
* You can install these packages using pip:
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib opencv-python

### Running the model
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-Ankit-RV/Salon-Skin-Care-An-AI-Based-Skin-Analysis-Tool.git

### Model Architecture

The model is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. It consists of multiple convolutional layers and max pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.

### Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is a collection of skin images labeled with acne, oiliness, or the need for UV protection. The dataset is not included in this repository, but you can obtain it from

### Results
The model achieves an accuracy of 60% on the test set.

### Limitations
* The model is only trained to detect acne, oiliness, and the need for UV protection. It may not perform well on other skin conditions.
* The model's accuracy may vary depending on the quality of the input image.


### Conclusion
This AI-based skin analysis tool can help salon professionals diagnose skin conditions more accurately. With further development, this model could be used as a valuable tool for the beauty industry.
